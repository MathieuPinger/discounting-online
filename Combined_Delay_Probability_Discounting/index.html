                <h3>Who is conducting the study?</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                We are scientists from the Department Clinical Psychology directed by Prof. Dr. Peter Kirsch 
                at the Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim, Germany. This study aims at developing and 
                validating decision-making tasks with a representative sample of participants. 
                Participants are volunteers who are recruited on survey platforms and who will be reimbursed 
                for the time taken to complete this study.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Why is this study being done?</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                We are investigating how future events influence 
                decision-making processes. The primary aim of this study is to find choice patterns 
                in situations where participants have to decide between smaller immediate/certain and larger 
                delayed/uncertain monetary losses. Studies have shown that participants with addiction 
                problems consider future losses to a lesser degree. The study you are participating in 
                is designed to refine the behavioral tasks that will be used for future studies in our 
                laboratory. This serves to further understand how aversive and rewarding events 
                are processed in decisions between immediate and future events.

            <h3>What will happen in this study?</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                If you agree to be in this study, you will first fill out a few demographic questions.
                You will then complete the experiment online 
                using your web browser. On the next pages, the task will be explained in detail.
                The task consists of trials where you have to decide between two <b>hypothetical</b> 
                monetary losses: a smaller immediate and/or certain loss, or a larger 
                loss that is delayed and/or uncertain. The amounts of money, the temporal delay (in days) and 
                the probability (in percent) for the future loss will be varied. Trials of both conditions will be displayed in random order. 
                At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to fill out several 
                questions regarding your demographics, your behavior in specific situations and your 
                consumption of alcohol.
                </p>
                
                <h3>How long will the study last?</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                Participation in this experiment will take place over one session and will last 
                <b>between 20 and 30 minutes</b>.
                </p>

                <h3>Will you be compensated for participating in this study?</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                In compensation for your time, you will receive <b>£3.75</b> via Prolific 
                once you have completed the experiment.
                Other than the compensation you receive, there is no direct benefit to you from 
                participating this study. However, you are contributing to scientific progress and 
                society may benefit from the knowledge that is acquired in this experiment.

                Dr Janine Thome, Mr Patrick Halli and Mr Mathieu Pinger. This study is part 
                of the Collaborative Research Centre TRR265: Losing and Regaining Control over 
                Drug Intake, a trans-regional collaboration funded by the Germany Research Foundation (DFG).

                <h3>Information about data protection</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                All data will be handled in accordance with the DSGVO 
                (General Data Protection Regulation Act, 2016). 
                The experiment is hosted on a secure internet connection (with a https certificate) and the 
                data is encrypted and stored on a secure server which is under the administration of the 
                IT department of the Central Institute of Mental Health. 
                Personal data (e.g., any communication you send us via email about the experiment) will be stored 
                separately from your research data (e.g., age, sex, gender, education, ethnicity, alcohol consumption, 
                decision-making in the tasks). You will be assigned a random participant ID and be known only by this ID. 
                Your personal data and your research data will not 
                be linked. Therefore, your research data are stored anonymously. 
                The personal data that you may provide (e.g., your personal email address due to contacting 
                us via email) will be securely and temporarily stored during any correspondence on a  
                protected email account hosted at the Central Institute of Mental Health under the 
                administration of the IT department of the Central Institute of Mental Health. 
                Once any correspondence is completed the correspondence alongside your 
                email address will be deleted. We believe that sharing data openly is good scientific practice, 
                so your anonymized research data may later be shared with other researchers and research funding 
                bodies via data sharing services (e.g., The Open Science Framework, 
                The German Research Foundation (DFG), etc.). 
                For that reason, the data will be stored indefinitely. Because your data are anonymous and we will 
                not able to tell which data belongs to you, we will also not be able to 
                delete your data if you request it.
