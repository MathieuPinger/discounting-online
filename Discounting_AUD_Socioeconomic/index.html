                <h3>Who is conducting the study?</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                We are scientists from the Department Clinical Psychology directed by Prof. Dr. Peter Kirsch 
                at the Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim, Germany. This study aims at replicating findings 
                of associations between decision-making behavior and addiction 
                with a representative sample of participants.  
                Participants are volunteers who are recruited on survey platforms and who will be reimbursed 
                for the time taken to complete this study.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Why is this study being done?</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                We are investigating how future events influence 
                decision-making processes. The primary aim of this study is to find choice patterns 
                in situations where participants have to decide between smaller immediate and larger 
                delayed monetary wins or losses. Studies have shown that participants with addiction 
                problems consider future wins to a lesser degree. In our study, we wish to 
                extend this to decisions between losses and to explore the influence of socioeconomic factors. 
                This serves to further understand how choice patterns in decisions between immediate and future 
                events are connected to addictive behaviour.

            <h3>What will happen in this study?</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                If you agree to be in this study, you will complete the experiment online 
                using your web browser. On the next pages, the task will be explained in detail.
                The task consists of two conditions where you have to decide between two <b>imaginary</b> 
                amounts of money: in one condition, 
                you have to decide between a smaller immediate win or a larger win in the future. 
                In the other condition, you have to decide between a smaller immediate loss or a larger 
                loss in the future. The amounts of money and the temporal delay for the future option 
                will be varied. Trials of both conditions will be displayed in separate blocks.
                At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to fill out several 
                questionnaires regarding your demographics (age, education, employment, personal and household income, 
                financial well-being during your adolescence, subjective socioeconomic status), your 
                consumption of alcohol, and your typical behavior in specific situations.
                </p>
                
                <h3>How long will the study last?</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                Participation in this experiment will take place over one session and will last 
                <b>between 20 and 30 minutes</b>.
                </p>

                <h3>Will you be compensated for participating in this study?</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                In compensation for your time, you will receive <b>Â£3.75</b> via Prolific 
                once you have completed the experiment.
                Other than the compensation you receive, there is no direct benefit to you from 
                participating this study. However, you are contributing to scientific progress and 
                society may benefit from the knowledge that is acquired in this experiment.

                <h3>Information about data protection</h3>
                <p align='left'>
                All data will be handled in accordance with the DSGVO 
                (General Data Protection Regulation Act, 2016). 
                The experiment is hosted on a secure internet connection (with a https certificate) and the 
                data is encrypted and stored on a secure server which is under the administration of the 
                IT department of the Central Institute of Mental Health. 
                Personal data (e.g., any communication you send us via email about the experiment) will be stored 
                separately from your research data (e.g., age, sex, gender, education, income, alcohol consumption, 
                decision-making in the tasks). You will be assigned a random participant ID and be known only by this ID. 
                Your Prolific ID will be stored separately and only be used for submission approval. 
                Your personal data and your research data will not 
                be linked. Therefore, your research data are stored anonymously. 
                The personal data that you may provide (e.g., your personal email address due to contacting 
                us via email) will be securely and temporarily stored during any correspondence on a  
                protected email account hosted at the Central Institute of Mental Health under the 
                administration of the IT department of the Central Institute of Mental Health. 
                Once any correspondence is completed the correspondence alongside your 
                email address will be deleted. We believe that sharing data openly is good scientific practice, 
                so your anonymized research data may later be shared with other researchers and research funding 
                bodies via data sharing services (e.g., The Open Science Framework, 
                The German Research Foundation (DFG), etc.). 
                For that reason, the data will be stored indefinitely. Because your data are anonymous and we will 
                not able to tell which data belongs to you, we will also not be able to 
                delete your data if you request it.
