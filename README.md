# Online Discounting Studies

This is a public repository for online studies used in the TRR265 project (Losing and Regaining Control over Drug Intake).

A few important notes:
* The paper repositories contain the <b>original code</b> used for a study
* The original code was <b>not optimized or refactored</b> before publication - it's not pretty
* A reproducible, (legible), refactored general online study framework is under construction 
* You will need a local server (e.g. XAMPP) to run any of the studies locally
* Most data is double-saved in a MySQL database and flat csv files (/data) - you don't need a Database but it's much, much easier to use
* Please contact me if you have any questions or wish to set up the framework for your own study
